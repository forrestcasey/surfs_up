## Overview of the statistical analysis:
  -W. Avy wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Summary statstics using sqlalchemy and pandas will help establish this comparative analysis. 


## (Results) There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December:

## (Summary)  There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. 
 - ![Avg_temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90353852/143796327-4b18ccb5-ecbc-4d17-8d09-94118d9a2e72.png)
 -In finding the average temperatures for the month of June comparative to December, there is a difference in temperature of 3.9 degrees. June's average temps were 74.94 degrees where December's average was at 71.04. This data would suggest that this is a good consistent location to set up shop. The higher standard deviation of December marginally makes this month's temperatures to be more variable.
